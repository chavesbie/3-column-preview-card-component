## My process

I started with an unordered list and center them int he page. Each list has the icons, the paragraph, the text and the buttom.
I found it easier this way, because when I edit them in CSS, was used only three classes.
As you can see in the file, It's not fill with lots of divs to edit.


### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS3 

### What I learned

The fact that I could edited a lot of content at once was somethig that i learned in a online class and udeing it was great. 
I also had problems with the display of the contents, but I fixed it to fill the page.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This helped me to find the right names. I really liked this page and will use it going forward.
